Technique,Coding Complexity,Typical Use Cases,When to Use,Strengths,Weaknesses
Linear Regression,Simple,"Continuous target variable, interpretability","Baseline model, linear relationships","Simple to understand, interpretable coefficients","Sensitive to outliers, limited to linear relationships"
Ridge Regression,Moderate,"Continuous target variable, high collinearity","Reduce overfitting, improve model stability","Reduces variance, handles correlated features",Less interpretable coefficients compared to linear regression
Lasso Regression,Moderate,"Continuous target variable, feature selection","Variable selection, reduce overfitting","Performs feature selection, good for sparse data","May not select the most important features, coefficients can be zeroed out"
Elastic Net Regression,Moderate,"Continuous target variable, feature selection with high collinearity","Combines Ridge and Lasso, handles correlated features","Balances feature selection and shrinkage, good for complex data",Tuning hyperparameters can be complex
Polynomial Regression,Simple-Moderate (depends on polynomial degree),"Continuous target variable, non-linear relationships",Model non-linear relationships,Can capture complex relationships,"Prone to overfitting, interpretability reduces with higher degrees"
SVR (Support Vector Regression),Moderate,"Continuous target variable, high-dimensional data","Robust to outliers, works well in high dimensions","Effective for noisy data, good for small datasets","Kernel selection can be complex, less interpretable"
Decision Tree Regression,Simple-Moderate,"Continuous target variable, interpretability","Handle non-linear relationships, interpretable structure","Easy to understand, works well with various data types","Prone to overfitting, unstable predictions"
Random Forest Regression,Moderate,"Continuous target variable, high variance","Robust model, reduces overfitting","High accuracy, handles missing values","Less interpretable than single decision tree, computationally expensive"
Gradient Boosting Regression,Moderate-Complex,Continuous target variable (high accuracy),High accuracy models,"Powerful ensemble method, reduces bias","Less interpretable, computationally expensive to train"
XGBoost Regression,Moderate-Complex,Continuous target variable (especially complex problems),Highly accurate and scalable,"State-of-the-art performance, efficient",More complex to tune compared to Gradient Boosting
