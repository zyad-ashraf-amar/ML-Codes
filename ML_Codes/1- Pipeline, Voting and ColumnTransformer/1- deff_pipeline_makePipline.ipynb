    "# Summary of Differences\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Naming of Steps:\n",
    "- Pipeline: Requires explicit naming of each step.\n",
    "- make_pipeline: Automatically names each step based on its type.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Usage:\n",
    "- Pipeline: More suitable for complex pipelines where step names are needed for reference.\n",
    "- make_pipeline: Ideal for simple, straightforward pipelines where explicit names are not necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Flexibility:\n",
    "- Pipeline: Offers more control and flexibility.\n",
    "- make_pipeline: More convenient but less customizable.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Code Readability:\n",
    "- Pipeline: Provides clearer, more descriptive names for each step.\n",
    "- make_pipeline: Provides a more concise and streamlined code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "Use Pipeline when you need to reference specific steps by name or when working with more complex pipelines. Use make_pipeline for simpler and more straightforward pipelines to reduce boilerplate code and enhance readability."

    "# Pipeline Function\n",
    "The Pipeline function is a class that allows you to create a sequence of data processing steps (transformers) followed by a final estimator.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage\n",
    "- You explicitly define the names of each step in the pipeline.\n",
    "- More flexible and customizable.\n",
    "- Useful when you need to reference specific steps by name later (e.g., accessing intermediate steps).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advantages\n",
    "- Explicit naming allows for better readability and the ability to reference steps by name.\n",
    "- Useful for more complex pipelines where specific steps need to be accessed or modified."
